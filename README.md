A mindmap styled foundational course pertaining neural networks generated and structured by GPT4.
!!!freeplane required!!!

I would like to learn about neural networks- who better to learn it from than AI?

I prompted GPT4 to create a course layout with lessons and sublessons- it did.
I haven't added all points to the map yet because I want to iron some of them out.

Currently, I am prompting to generate the actual lesson content for the math basics- after comes neural net theory.
Individual lessons are structured as: high level explanation, low level explanation and example exercises.
The individual lessons are linked to the map as HTML documents created from GPT4's prompt responses.

This is going to be a solo project, and will take time to complete- I started 3h ago.
Feel free to track my progress, once completed, I'll see if I can have a SME look over it and suggest improvements.

I am choosing Rust and ASM as the languages I'll use to build my own neural networks (eventually, we're mot there yet),
because I plan on developing fairly small neural networks that need to be efficient, memory safe and run quickly.
